Check TFF approach on a single step. Investigate whether we can
define a tf.Keras.Module Federated Type, i.e, '{MODEL}@CLIENTS', MODEL=?????

tff.learning.models.from_keras_model

literally only change `clients_train_naive/linear/sketch` nothing else.
after quick research: Possible.


devil's advocate:
You will see in research that we pass model.trainable_variables each time. Why not
simple Tensorflow and Graphs? (make sure this is true, the `model.trainable_vars` part)
