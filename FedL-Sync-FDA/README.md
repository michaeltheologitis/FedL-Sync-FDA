# FedL-Sync-FDA

## Overview

This project is a well-structured Python implementation of the Jupyter notebook originally found at `/notebooks/completed/10_tf_sim_fda_nn.ipynb`. While the original notebook had all the code and logic in a single file, this project organizes the code into a modular, package-based structure, making it more maintainable and easy to understand.
