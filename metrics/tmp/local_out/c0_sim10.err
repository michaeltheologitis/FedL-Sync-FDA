WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function DenseNet.trainable_vars_as_vector at 0x7f25b8b2f920> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors.
