WARNING:tensorflow:11 out of the last 11 calls to <function AdvancedCNN.step at 0x7f3ae9e840d0> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors.
